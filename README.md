Step: 0   A = 0   B = 0   
Step: 1   A = 0   B = 5   
Step: 2   A = 3   B = 2   
Step: 3   A = 0   B = 2   
Step: 4   A = 2   B = 0   
Step: 5   A = 2   B = 5   
Step: 6   A = 3   B = 4   

Water Buckets - Fill Left to Right

Step: 0   A = 0   B = 0   
Step: 1   A = 3   B = 0   
Step: 2   A = 0   B = 3   
Step: 3   A = 3   B = 3   
Step: 4   A = 1   B = 5   
Step: 5   A = 1   B = 0   
Step: 6   A = 0   B = 1   
Step: 7   A = 3   B = 1   
Step: 8   A = 0   B = 4
