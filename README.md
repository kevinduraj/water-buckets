Get target quantity into a bucket
=================================

####Keep filling two buckets from source or each other until target is reached 


```
Right to Left A=3,B=5,Target=4
------------------------------------
Step: 0		A = 0		B = 0		
Step: 1		A = 0		B = 5		
Step: 2		A = 3		B = 2		
Step: 3		A = 0		B = 2		
Step: 4		A = 2		B = 0		
Step: 5		A = 2		B = 5		
Step: 6		A = 3		B = 4		

Left to Right A=3,B=5,Target=4
------------------------------------
Step: 0		A = 0		B = 0		
Step: 1		A = 0		B = 5		
Step: 2		A = 3		B = 2		
Step: 3		A = 0		B = 2		
Step: 4		A = 2		B = 0		
Step: 5		A = 2		B = 5		
Step: 6		A = 3		B = 4		

Right to Left A=9,B=12,Target=6
------------------------------------
Step: 0		A = 0		B = 0		
Step: 1		A = 0		B = 12		
Step: 2		A = 9		B = 3		
Step: 3		A = 0		B = 3		
Step: 4		A = 3		B = 0		
Step: 5		A = 3		B = 12		
Step: 6		A = 9		B = 6		

Left to Right A=9,B=12,Target=6
------------------------------------
Step: 0		A = 0		B = 0		
Step: 1		A = 0		B = 12		
Step: 2		A = 9		B = 3		
Step: 3		A = 0		B = 3		
Step: 4		A = 3		B = 0		
Step: 5		A = 3		B = 12		
Step: 6		A = 9		B = 6
